This project lets you practice essential skills like building layouts, applying styles, and using classes and ids for targeted formatting and it also helps me to understand few more concepts in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to design a Responsive website adoptable for different Desktop and Mobile screen sizes. It's a great way to gain practical experience in front-end development!
